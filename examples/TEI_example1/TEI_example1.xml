       <p>As saith that most delicious of love poems that makes us all feel immoral as we read it. It
        is the hour when chanticleer retires to his perch in the henhouse, lowers his proud tail, sinks
        his neck into his breast, and goes to sleep between his two fattest wives. It is the hour when
        animal life and wild humanity retire to bed; the hour when tamed humanity sits down to dinner.
        The more we advance in civilisation the farther back we push the boundaries of sleep and
        forgetfulness. When we reach our highest point of culture, I suppose we shall hustle the
        blessed, the divine Nepenthe, off the face of the earth altogether.</p>

    <p>THE weekly clearance of mundane books has been made at Plas Berwyn; the skimp drab gowns, and
     the ill-made frock coat, whose flaps lap over one another so painfully behind, have been
     endured by the Misses Brandon and their brother respectively. At church has been all the
     Brandon household: son and daughters, man-servant and maid-servant, ox and sheep, camel and
     ass. I need hardly say that the last quartette have been introduced merely for the sake of
     euphony, and to give a fuller rhythm to the close of the sentence. The Misses Brandon always
     stand as stiff as pokers during the creed, with their backs to the altar. It amuses them, and
     it does not do anybody else any harm, so why should not they, poor women? Bob truckles to the
     Scarlet Woman; he bows, and turns his honest, serious face to the east. The service is in
     Welsh, of which he does not understand a word. He can pick his way pretty well through the
     prayers, however, by the help of a Welsh and English prayer book. There are several landmarks
     that he knows, whose friendly faces beam upon him now and again when he is beginning to
     flounder hopelessly among uncouth words of seven consonants and a vowel. These are his chief
     finger-posts: <quote><foreign xml:lang="cy">" Gogoniant ir Tad, ac ir Mab, ac ir Yspryd

      <p>THUS the grave yawns for another victim, and having swallowed him, and a million more that
       same day, returns to its former state of insatiable famished greed. It is a law—natural, wise,
       and comprehensible by the feeblest understanding—that all created beings, in which there is
       progressive life, must come forth, ripen, decay, and fall. But why, oh! why, in too many cases
       does the decay and fall forerun the ripening? Why is so many a worm permitted to gnaw out so
       many a closed bud's green heart? Why is the canker death allowed to pasture on so many an
       unblown life? Why are so many little toddling children, not yet come into the heritage of
       reason to which we are all by our human birth entitled, borne from their mother's emptied arms
       to their small short graves? Is it, as Hartley Coleridge very nobly, whether truly or untruly,
       said— <quote>
        <l rend="ti-3">"God only made them for his Christ to save?"</l></quote>
      </p>
      <p>Very wasteful is the mighty mother, knowing that her materials are inexhaustible. And so they
       lay Jack down in the wormy grave. <quote>

        <l rend="ti-3">With his few faults shut up like dead flow'rets."</l></quote></p>
